# BugTracker

A bug tracker is a software application that is used to track and manage reported bugs and issues in software development projects. It allows developers to record and organize details about bugs, including the severity, priority, and status of each bug. It also allows developers to assign bugs to specific team members, track progress on bug fixes.

# Using

The project isn't hosted anywhere. But you can run this on your local machine using 'NodeJS' and 'MySQL Server' like me. To do so, you will need to follow this steps:

1. Download All files from repo
2. Run your MySQL Server and use SQL script to build a database
<!-- Add a script of database -->
3. Then after checking port of your database, open console in "Backend" folder run in console script 'npm install' then 'npm run start'
4. Then do the same with "Frontend" folder
5. Your browser should be opned automaticly with home page of BugTracker
